<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This program was my first attempt at implementing the core concepts of genetic algorithms (fitness -> mutation/crossover -> pruning -> â†µ). I would improve my understanding of these concepts when approaching a harder genetic algorithm problem: [GitHub: Blackjack-Genetic](https://github.com/KevinTyrrell/Blackjack-Genetic) (teaching agents how to play well at Blackjack using genetic algorithms).


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Prerequisites

* Python 3

> Auto generated by [Argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) via commit [3871564](https://github.com/KevinTyrrell/PrisonersDilemma-Py/commit/387156477fcaa9ac088c418d6190f755d8bb371e).

```
usage: PrisonersDilemma.py [-h] [-p POPULATION] [-g GENERATIONS]
                           [-m MUTATION_RATE] [-t TESTS] [-s SEED]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help        show this help message and exit
  -p POPULATION     Specifies the population size for the group of prisoners.
                    (default: 1024)
  -g GENERATIONS    Specifies the number of generations which should be
                    simulated. (default: 100)
  -m MUTATION_RATE  Specifies the rate in which mutations occur in each
                    genome. (default: 0.15)
  -t TESTS          Specifies the number of tests the prisoners are subjected
                    to per generation. (default: 10)
  -s SEED           Specifies the random number generator seed to be used.
                    (default: 1071815745)
```

#### Example Training Takeaways

* Defection rate approaches `100%`, however poor mutations stunt further overall-progress.
* Low average age is normal, due to half of the population having an age of `0` (new-born). However it appears as if ancestors are being culled before reaching high ages of maturity. Perhaps with far more generations, the average age would rise.
* Raising the number of Prisoner\'s Dilemma tests per generation seems to dramatically speed up the learning process. Fewer better-performing prisoners are culled by mistake, and thus the population develops faster.
* By generation `15`, over `90%` of the population choses to defect. Over the next `35` generations, this is only refined by ~`5%`.
